# multipage_dash

start the app with index.py

the first value is initiated in app2.py, which is the RadioItems of the 2nd page,

i store the created value in the index.py as         
  "dcc.Store(id='session', storage_type='session')"
  
And my goal is to show the value in the id="result" of app2.py, and the id="results" of app3.py.
